Welcome to my GitHub project! This repository contains a collection of integration and functionality test cases designed for some of the most popular apps we use every day. These apps include WhatsApp, Facebook, Ola, Zomato, MakeMyTrip, and more. The goal of this project is to ensure these apps work seamlessly and provide a great user experience.
